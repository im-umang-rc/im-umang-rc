# Hi There!

I’m a software engineer with a track record of leading high-impact projects across cloud, backend, and infrastructure domains. From building cost visibility tools for MLaaS platforms and modernizing legacy systems to driving compliance initiatives under tight deadlines, I bring a pragmatic, ownership-driven approach to solving complex engineering problems.

I’ve led cost-saving initiatives for MLaaS platforms, built flexible query frameworks for BigQuery, and secured critical systems without full-scale upgrades—all while coordinating across globally distributed teams. My work consistently bridges the gap between business needs and technical solutions, whether that means delivering 7 applications in under a month, scaling systems for 10k+ concurrent users, or enabling seamless migrations with zero downtime.

Tech Highlights: Java, Spring Boot, Docker, AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, SQL

I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments and enjoy taking ownership from design through delivery—whether that’s unblocking cross-team alignment, crafting test strategies across product lines, or digging deep into logs to troubleshoot the “unfixable.”

Let’s connect if you're building reliable, scalable systems—or navigating the messiness of real-world engineering with creativity and grit. Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umangrc/)
